# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest stable version for security issues.  
See the [releases page](https://github.com/NovaXdevs/Winter_Craft_Reborn/releases).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We ask that you report vulnerabilities privately, by contacting the NovaX team,  
to give us time to fix them. You can do that by emailing:

* novaxdevs@gmail.com

Depending on severity, we will either create a private issue for the vulnerability  
and release a patch version of Winter Craft Reborn, or give you permission to file the issue publicly.

For more information on the justification of this policy, see
